# SleepHealthProject

The project is to help me gain a better understanding of how to use frameworks and programming languages, including Django, Python, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

The main focus is to show how to effectively integrate DataTables in a Django application and perform various advanced grid functionalities:

Server-side processing: Efficient handling of large datasets from the CSV file.
Client-side processing: Instant feedback and interaction for smaller datasets.
Child rows: Ability to include expandable detailed information about a row.
Sorting and Filtering: Customizable sorting and filtering, including types like Date Time, String, and Decimal.
Paging: Easy navigation through the table pages.
Column Visibility: Functionality to toggle the visibility of specific columns.
Advanced Filtering: Both column-specific and global data filter options.
